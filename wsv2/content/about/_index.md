I'm a married father of two kids, who works in Glasgow as a Lead UI Developer in a UX Team.

I am passionate about CSS / Semantic HTML / Accessibility / Usability.  I have experience in ReactJS, Angular, Bootstrap, various grid and chart libraries, as well as many other useless things.

Outside of work I support Motherwell FC; I occassionally ride my mountain bike and have an unhealthy love of Land Rover Defenders.

We have an amazing dog called Buster who we all love dearly and he keeps us all busy.
