I'm a married father of two kids, who works in Glasgow as a Lead UI Developer in a UX Team.

I'm passionate about CSS / Semantic HTML / Accessibility / Usability.  I've various levels of experience in ReactJS, Angular, Bootstrap, graph and chart libraries, as well as many other useless things.

Outside of work I can be found supporting Motherwell FC or the Scottish national Football and Rugby teams; I ride my mountain bike and have an unhealthy love of Land Rover Defenders.

We have an amazing doggo called Buster - who has won all our hearts and we love dearly.  He keeps us all busy, with regular walks and trips to the beaches in and around Ayrshire.
