      <description>Over the last few sprints I’ve been allocated what should have been a relatively straightforward piece of work. We did our sprint planning and all gave it a manageable sprint score.
Like all good adventures, first appearances were highly inaccurate. Between API calls; code base gremlins; lack of clarity and a laptop that didn’t know which way was up – it became a much more stressful and frustrating build that it had ever needed to be.</description>

      <description>Since early July I’ve been working in a different team at my firm. We use mob programming for a variety of reasons, which I’d like to share.
Our team has been formed from a bunch of skills bases, some seasoned Java developers and some complete novices. We also have a Modern Apprentice, a recent University graduate and two members who have come through a coding bootcamp.
We share a codebase with another team, with us focusing on mainly Front End tasks to begin with, now completing tasks from end-to-end.</description>
