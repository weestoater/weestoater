      <description>Over the last few sprints I’ve been allocated what should have been a relatively straightforward piece of work. We did our sprint planning and all gave it a manageable sprint score.
Like all good adventures, first appearances were highly inaccurate. Between API calls; code base gremlins; lack of clarity and a laptop that didn’t know which way was up – it became a much more stressful and frustrating build that it had ever needed to be.</description>

      <description>Since early July I’ve been working in a different team at my firm. We use mob programming for a variety of reasons, which I’d like to share.
Our team has been formed from a bunch of skills bases, some seasoned Java developers and some complete novices. We also have a Modern Apprentice, a recent University graduate and two members who have come through a coding bootcamp.
We share a codebase with another team, with us focusing on mainly Front End tasks to begin with, now completing tasks from end-to-end.</description>

      <description>…and you’ll never work a day in your life…
 Anyone who knows me will appreciate that I regularly recite this mantra but I’ve perhaps been fooling myself a little in that I haven’t really ‘loved’ my job for the last wee while.
After some head scratching, a couple of properly difficult months and a bit of networking – I’ve made a sideways move to a Lead UI Developer role at work and am now finally following my long standing passion for all things front-end related.</description>

      <description>In a number of hobby projects I’ve been banging my head off the coding wall on how to tackle front end testing. I’ve been working in ReactJS a lot, for my projects, so decided to do a bit of research and I’m really glad I did.
I found out about an amazingly talented developer called Kent C. Dodds and have been following his guidance on what and how to test things in JavaScript projects.</description>
